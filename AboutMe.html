    <h3>Hi, my name is John Sven Gorres. I was born on June 6, 2006, in Tondo, Manila. Currently, I am studying at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM) as a first-year college student, pursuing a degree in Bachelor of Science in Entrepreneurship. Even though I am enrolled in this course, I don't feel fully connected to it and plan to shift to Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) in my second year, as that is where my passion truly lies.
        <br><br>
        In my free time, I have various hobbies that keep me active and engaged. I enjoy playing video games, which has been a big part of my life, and exercising regularly, as it helps me stay healthy and energized. Sleeping and eating are also simple pleasures I love. But what I enjoy most of all is coding. I’ve recently developed a deep interest in programming and find joy in creating and solving problems through code. I know that these skills will be important for my future career, especially when I transition to IT.
        <br><br>
        Although I don’t have any major achievements in school yet, I am determined to study hard and do my best in everything. I know how important education is, not only for me but also for my family, and I want to succeed to help them in the future. It’s my goal to graduate, and I am willing to work hard to make sure that happens.
